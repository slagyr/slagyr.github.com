      <h1>Hangman Tournament</h1>
<p>
A Ruby sparring tournament. Compete by building a computer AI to play
hangman.
</p>
<h2>Participating</h2>
<p>
There are 4 simple steps to participate.
</p>
<p>
1 Install the hangman_tournament gem
</p>
<pre>
  sudo gem install hangman_tournament
</pre>
<p>
2 Create a player (computer AI) with a creative and unique name
</p>
<pre>
  generate_hangman_player &quot;Some Creative and Unique Name&quot;
</pre>
<p>
3 Build and install your player&#8216;s ruby gem
</p>
<pre>
  # Install the rspec gem if needed
  # sudo gem install rspec
  cd some_creative_and_unique_name
  rake gem
  sudo gem install pkg/hangman_some_creative_and_unique_name-1.0.gem
</pre>
<p>
4 Enter data, choose password, and submit your player
</p>
<pre>
  # Edit Rakefile and provide the information indicated.
  rake submit
</pre>
<h2>Try Out Your Player</h2>
<p>
You&#8216;ll need Limelight to watch your player play.
</p>
<p>
1 Download an installer from <a
href="http://limelight.8thlight.com">limelight.8thlight.com</a>. (Minimum
version required is 0.4.0)
</p>
<p>
2 Install
</p>
<p>
3 Create a Limelight Link file
</p>
<pre>
  echo &quot;http://slagyr.github.com/sparring/hangman/hangman.llp&quot; &gt; ~/Desktop/hangman.lll
</pre>
<p>
4 Go to your desktop and double click on hangman.lll. Or if you&#8216;ve
installed the Limelight gem&#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  jruby -S limelight open ~/Desktop/hangman.lll
</pre>
<p>
Click on the link at the top that says &quot;Computer AIs&quot; You should
see your player in the list along with Letter Letdown. Have it play a few
games. Perform some analysis to see how your code holds up.
</p>
<h2>Improve Your Player&#8216;s AI</h2>
<p>
The source code for your player is contained in one file:
</p>
<pre>
  some_creative_and_unique_name/lib/some_creative_and_unique_name/some_creative_and_unique_name.rb
</pre>
<p>
You&#8216;ll also find an lack of specs in the file:
</p>
<pre>
  some_creative_and_unique_name/spec/some_creative_and_unique_name/some_creative_and_unique_name_spec.rb
</pre>
<p>
Use of rSpec is required.
</p>
<p>
There are plenty of comments in the generated source code. Go nuts! Add
code. Change code. Add files. Turn your player into a masterful hangman AI.
</p>
<p>
When your player is ready, be sure to submit again. Make sure you remember
your players password. You may submit as many times as you like. Each
submission will overwrite the previous submission.
</p>
<pre>
  rake submit
</pre>
<h2>Email List</h2>
<p>
Join the email list. Use it for questions and discussion about the
tournament.

</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
You have until September 30th, 2009 to submit your final solution. On
October 1st, competition begins. Each player will play many many games of
hangman. All players will receive the same words in the same order. The
Tournament Champion will be the player that wins the most games.
</p>
<p>
However, there is a more prestigious title to which players should aspire.
The Tournament Master. This coveted title is awarded not to the player who
wins the most games but to the player that also has the best source code. A
series of metrics will be collected on your player&#8216;s source code and
compiled into an all-round score. The player with the best all-round score
will be honored as Tournament Master.
</p>
<p>
The Hangman Limelight production provides a Locker Room scene where you can
run some sample analysis on your player. This is just an example of the
analysis that will be performed but it should give you an idea of what is
expected.
</p>
<p>
Solutions may NOT make use of ruby gems. The tournament is about crafting a
complete solution.
</p>
<h3>Analysis Dependancies</h3>
<p>
To run full analysis, you will have to have the following gems, and their
dependancies, installed:
</p>
<pre>
 * flog
 * rCov
 * rSpec
 * flay
</pre>
<h2>Terms for Disqualification</h2>
<pre>
 1 Attempting to open or modify classes, modules, or objects in the Hangman engine.
 2 Tampering with the Hangman.Rakefile file.
 3 Providing invalid letter guesses.
 4 Making use of Kernel.set_trace_func
 5 Tampering or abusing tournament infrastructure and facilities
</pre>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>None of the players are showing up in the player lists.</h3>
<p>
First check that the player gems are installed. It&#8216;s likely that the
Hangman engine cannot find them. We&#8216;ll have to tell it where it can
find the gems. Mac:
</p>
<pre>
  ruby -r &quot;rubygems&quot; -e &quot;File.open(File.expand_path('~/.gem_home'), 'w') { |f| f.write Gem.dir }&quot;
</pre>
<p>
Windows: Find your gem directory. In you home directory (C:\Documents and
Settings\Micah) create a file named &#8216;gem_home.txt&#8217; containing
the path to your gem directory.
</p>
<h3>When submitting, I get the error: Could not find installed gem named &#8216;one_dot_two_test&#8216;</h3>
<p>
This is a problem in the hangman_tournament-1.1.gem. Install version 1.2
and the problem should be resolved.
